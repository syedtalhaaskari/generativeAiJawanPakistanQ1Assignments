# Write a program that accepts 3 input from user and check which number is largest.
# for example:
# input1 is 5 and input2 is 10 and input3 is 15
# output should be 15 as this number is larger than 5 and 10

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

print(max(num1, num2, num3))
